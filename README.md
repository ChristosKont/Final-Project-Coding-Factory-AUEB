# MovieSharer-App
This is a website where you can share your favorite movies. First of all, there is a registration system where you can create your own account
and a login system where you can sign in and see the movies that other users have shared. As a user, you have the ability to add your favorite movie
with some details such as the title of the movie, the genre of the movie, description of the movie where you have to include actors etc. As an admin, you can only edit and delete all the movies that users have uploaded. Furthermore, you can interact with other users by pressing the like or the dislike button in order to share your view about each movie.
Moreover, if someone doesn't have the time to search all the movies that users have posted, he/she has the ability to filter the movies by sorting them in descending order based on the date the movie was uploaded by the user,
likes and dislikes. Moreover, users can edit their own uploaded movies or delete them. Finally, there is a JWT authentication system for the Rest API.
The technology that has been used in this website is Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Html, Css & Bootstrap.
