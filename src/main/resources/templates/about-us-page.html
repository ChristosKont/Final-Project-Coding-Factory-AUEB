            <h2>A Project For The "Coding Factory" At AUEB</h2>
            <p>This is a website where you can share your favorite movies. First of all, there is a registration system where you can create your own account
                and a login system where you can sign in and see the movies that other users have shared. As a user, you have the ability to add your favorite movie
                with some details such as the title of the movie, the genre of the movie, description of the movie where you have to include actors etc. Furthermore, you can interact with other
                users by pressing the like or the dislike button in order to share your view about each movie. Moreover, if someone doesn't have the time to search all the movies
                that users have posted, he/she has the ability to filter the movies by sorting them in descending order based on the date the movie was uploaded by the user,
                likes and dislikes. Moreover, users can edit their own uploaded movies or delete them. Finally, the technology that has been used in this website is Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Html, Css & Bootstrap.</p>
